# Machine Learning Wildfires in California Models

## Project Description

This project uses the first open source wildfire dataset that combines historical wildfire occurrences in California with relevant features extracted from satellite imagery. Created and maintained by a group of researchers from Vanderbilt University, the University of California, Riverside, and Stanford University in U.S.

I selected the most important 46 features from a total of 397 to create predictions using Machine Learning and Time Series models from 2012 to 2020. This project also contains visualization about the canopy features through the years and the trend of wildfires.

## Variables used

 Years 2012, 2014 and 2016

- Canopy density 
- Canopy base height 
- Canopy cover 
- Canpy height 
- Elevation of vegetation
- Vegetation height 
- Type of vegetation


 Year 2016 

- Polygon elevation 
- Height of burned vegetation
- Type of burned vegetation 
- Inclination of the polygon


 Year 2012 to 2018

- Number of daily wildfires per polygon 
- Radiative power of the fire
- Number of neighboring polygons set on fire daily
