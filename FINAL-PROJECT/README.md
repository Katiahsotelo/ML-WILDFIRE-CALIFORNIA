# Machine Learning Wildfires in California Models

## Project Description

This project uses the first open source wildfire dataset that combines historical wildfire occurrences in California with relevant features extracted from satellite imagery. Created and maintained by a group of researchers from Vanderbilt University, the University of California, Riverside, and Stanford University in  US.

From a total of  397 variable measured daily i used the most relevant 46  variables to make several Machine Learning and Time Series models from 2012 to 2020 to predict trends through the year

## Variables used
